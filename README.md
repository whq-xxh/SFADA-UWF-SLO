# SFADA-UWF-SLO
Advancing UWF-SLO Vessel Segmentation with Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation and a Novel Multi-Center Dataset (MICCAI 2024 Early accept ðŸŽ‰)

# Introduction ðŸ“‘

This project introduces a new setting in medical image segmentation, termed **Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA)**. SFADA aims to facilitate cross-center medical image segmentation while protecting data privacy and reducing the workload on medical professionals. By requiring only minimal labeling effort, SFADA achieves effective model transfer and results comparable to those of fully supervised approaches.
