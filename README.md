# SFADA-UWF-SLO
Advancing UWF-SLO Vessel Segmentation with Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation and a Novel Multi-Center Dataset (MICCAI 2024 Early accept 🎉)

# Introduction 📑

This project introduces a new setting in medical image segmentation, termed **Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA)**. SFADA aims to facilitate cross-center medical image segmentation while protecting data privacy and reducing the workload on medical professionals. By requiring only minimal labeling effort, SFADA achieves effective model transfer and results comparable to those of fully supervised approaches.

# How to Run the Code 🛠
### Environment Installation
### 1. Training source models in the source center
For setting up the environment and training the source model, please refer to the [[STDR]](https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-GTV-Seg) project. Please note that some hyperparameters, such as the image input resolution, may need to be adjusted.

### 2. CUP selection strategy 
Please refer to formulas 1 and 2 in the [[paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72114-4_8)  to calculate the values of _Prediction_mask_ and _Uncertainty_ respectively. Then, refer to `Core_Code_OA/divide_patch.py` to split the image into patch-level. `Core_Code_OA/step1.py` and `Core_Code_OA/step2.py` correspond to the Cascade Uncertainty Predominance (CUP) selection strategy. After completing the CUP selection, refer to `Core_Code_OA/Move.py` and `Core_Code_OA/patch2pic.py` to form the Enhanced-pseudo labels for fine-tuning the target model.

### 3. Finetune the source Model with actively enhanced-pseudo labels 
Please refer to the [[STDR]](https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-GTV-Seg) project.
